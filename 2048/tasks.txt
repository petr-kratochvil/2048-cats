Tasks:

1. The game now makes only left moves (other moves just add a new brick).
Enable top, bottom and right moves.

2. The game does not recognize, when it is full of bricks, and loops forever trying to add a random brick in a free field.
Handle the "game over" situation.

3. The game does not merge equal bricks, only moves them.
Enhance "applyGravityToStrip" function, so as it can merge bricks.

4. The game allows illegal moves, which would not move any bricks.
Disable buttons, when they would result in an illegal move.
