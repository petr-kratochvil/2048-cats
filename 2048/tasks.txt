* handle "game over" situation, so as the code does not loop forever (better random generation, or just check)
* write top, bottom and right functions
* enhance "applyGravityToStrip" function, so as it can merge bricks
* mark newly added brick with different color
* make some color codes for brick values
* it should not be possible to press a button, if it would not move any bricks (i.e. only add new random brick)
