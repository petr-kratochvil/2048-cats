Tasks:

1. The game now makes only left moves (other moves just add a new brick).
Enable top, bottom and right moves.

2. The game does not recognize, when it is full of bricks, and loops forever trying to add a random brick into a free field.
Handle the "game over" situation.

3. The game does not merge equal bricks, only moves them.
Enhance "applyGravityToStrip" function, so as it can merge bricks.

4. Now when the board is full of bricks, it is not necessary game over, if some move can still merge them.
Adjust the game over handling code.

5. The game still allows illegal moves, i.e., moves which would not move any bricks.
Disable buttons, when they would result in an illegal move (and enable them back, when their action becomes legal).
